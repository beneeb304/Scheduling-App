1. Create Logic for Appointments table (pretty difficult)
2. GUI commands
	- make button to drop appointment
	- make button to change appointment

?. Add loading bar on exit if deleting db?
?. Control focus

thoughts:
- should i populate the appointments table at load as empty and then change each time slot when a patient wants it?

- Yes, then remove from the empty slots from the appointments table as they are removed
- Could even do something like NOT select available slots for doctors appointments

- need to figure out the whole data thing...
